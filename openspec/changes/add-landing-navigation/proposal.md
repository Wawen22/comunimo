## Why
- The public landing page lacks a persistent navigation bar, making it harder for visitors to jump to key sections.
- A modern top navigation with smooth scrolling and visual progress improves usability and perceived polish.

## What Changes
- Add a sticky top navigation bar that exposes quick links to the major landing sections (hero, calendario, insights, ranking, engagement).
- Integrate a scroll progress indicator that reflects the user's vertical position within the landing content.
- Ensure the navigation adapts to mobile and desktop form factors with an accessible interaction pattern.

## Impact
- Enhances user experience on the landing page without affecting authenticated areas.
- Requires minor updates to landing layout components and shared UI primitives.
